FunctionalTraining
==================

Introducing functional programming to interested and enlightened people.

## Running and compiling

In the root directory there is a shell script called `gradlew` which does gradle things.

	$ ./gradlew test

## Completing the exercises

I've kept this quite simple.

There are five packages, covering the areas we will be covering in this course.

Remember:
- The types are the gateway to the solution.
- Avoid mutability at all costs.

Have fun.
